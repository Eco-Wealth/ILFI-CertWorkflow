# ILFI-CertWorkflow
comprehensive program modeling of the ILFI Building Certification Process Workflow


ILFI Building Certification Process Workflow

Phase 1: Registration
1.1. Team registers the project with ILFI.
1.2. ILFI issues an agreement for signature containing project details, fee schedule, and expectations.
1.3. Additional fees are assessed for specific activities (e.g., certification pathway changes, support meetings, consulting).
1.4. Team signs the agreement and pays the registration invoice.
1.5. ILFI advances the project in the Portal to the "Documentation Submission" stage.
1.6. Project team reviews Portal entries to ensure accuracy.
1.7. For LBC 4.0 and Core projects, the team completes the Submission Pathway form in the Portal to specify certification type and requirements.

Phase 2: Project Development/Coaching
2.1. Registered projects are assigned an ILFI project coach.
2.2. Teams have up to three 1-hour video calls with their coach.
2.3. Teams can email support inboxes for program clarifications.
2.4. Teams can request additional consulting services if needed.
2.5. Requests for Ruling forms are submitted for pre-approval as per Handbook guidance.

Phase 3: Changing Intended Certification
3.1. Registered teams may change the intended certification program.
3.2. Teams sign a new agreement and agree to the fee structure.
3.3. LBC 3.0 and 3.1 projects can upgrade individual Petals to LBC 4.0.
3.4. A $250 administrative fee is assessed for each Petal upgrade.
3.5. Teams communicate changes to lbc.certifications@living-future.org.

Phase 4: Audit
4.1. Audit process occurs in two parts: Ready Audit and Final Audit.
4.2. Third-party auditor conducts audits.
4.3. Ready Audit follows construction completion and results in "Ready" designation.
4.4. Final Audit occurs after a 12-month performance period with continuous occupancy.
4.5. The Final Audit leads to a Final Certification Ruling.
4.6. Teams can opt for a single audit for LBC 3.0 and 3.1 projects.
4.7. All project documentation is submitted through the Portal.
4.8. Certification invoice is generated upon uploading all relevant audit documentation.
4.9. Once paid, ILFI assigns an auditor, and the audit review begins.

Phase 5: Certification Rulings
5.1. Average audit cycle duration is 55 business days.
5.2. Clarification Requests allow project teams to resolve documentation issues.
5.3. Teams have one month to respond to Clarification Requests, extendable up to two times.
5.4. Failure to resolve issues results in the need for an Appeal.

Phase 6: Ready Audit
6.1. Auditor issues a ruling on Ready designation.
6.2. If requirements are met, the project achieves "Ready" designation.
6.3. If not, a successful Appeal is needed to proceed to the Final Audit.

Phase 7: Final Audit
7.1. Final Audit follows Ready designation and 12-month performance period.
7.2. Teams can inform ILFI of any anticipated delays.
7.3. Final Audit process and timing mirror the Ready Audit.
7.4. Auditor determines if the project meets Final Audit requirements.
7.5. Certification is granted if requirements are met.

Phase 8: Virtual Site Tour
8.1. For Core and LBC projects, a virtual site tour is conducted.
8.2. Teams provide access to project areas and answer auditor questions.
8.3. The virtual tour is coordinated by ILFI.
8.4. Failure to provide access may result in additional fees.

Phase 9: Projects Registered Prior to September 2020
9.1. Teams that selected a "single audit" have only a Final Audit.
9.2. This process includes one Clarification Request and one Final Certification Ruling.

Phase 10: Certification Ruling Appeal Process
10.1. Teams can initiate an Appeal if they disagree with the Certification Ruling.
10.2. Appeal must be initiated within 15 business days of receiving the Final Certification Ruling.
10.3. ILFI contacts the team to confirm the need for the appeal.
10.4. An Appeal agreement is issued, and an invoice is sent for the Appeal fee.
10.5. Teams have two months to provide updated documentation.
10.6. Documentation should address issues raised during the audit.

Phase 11: Cost of Appeal
11.1. Appeal costs vary by program:
      - Zero Energy: $2,000
      - Zero Carbon: $2,000 for Operational Energy Documentation Review and $2,000 for Embodied Carbon Documentation



The solidity contract provided is already quite comprehensive for modeling the ILFI Building Certification Process Workflow. However, if you have specific additional requirements or features you'd like to include, you can certainly extend the contract further. Here are some ideas for potential extensions:

Payment Handling: If there are payments associated with each phase, you can integrate a payment system into the contract to handle fees and payments.

Logging and Events: Add event logging to record important actions and changes in the contract's state. This can be useful for auditing and tracking.

Role-Based Access Control: Implement a role-based access control system to manage different roles within the certification process, such as project team leads, auditors, and administrators.

Documentation Storage: Create a way to securely store and access project documentation within the contract, possibly using IPFS or another decentralized storage solution.

Integration with Oracles: If you need real-world data or external information for the certification process, consider integrating with oracle services.

Automated Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert project teams about upcoming phases or actions required on their part.

Reporting and Analytics: Add functionality to generate reports and analytics on the certification process for monitoring and decision-making.

Remember that the complexity of the contract should align with the actual requirements of the certification process. Extending the contract should enhance its functionality while maintaining clarity and usability.
